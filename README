A ridiculously simple django app for helping with static web pages.
You can use django template syntax to keep the markup DRY

Usage:
    * drop an html file into the templates directory (e.g. foo.html)
    * run the app
    * type in a url that contains the name of your template whithout the extension (e.g. localhost:8000/foo)
    
By default index.html will be displayed
